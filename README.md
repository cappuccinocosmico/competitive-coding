# Nicole's Competitive Coding Garbage Bin
[![NO AI](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nuxy/no-ai-badge/master/badge.svg)](https://github.com/nuxy/no-ai-badge)

A dumping ground for all my competitive coding stuff. 

Right now it has mostly leetcode and AOC stuff. But I plan to add other stuff as it goes along.

### AI Usage 

AI was at no point used to generate any part of any solution, generate any ideas for solutions, or debug any broken solutions.

I might occasionally use it to write unit tests though.
